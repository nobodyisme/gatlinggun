class LockingQueue(object):
    """A distributed queue with priority and locking support.

    Upon retrieving an entry from the queue, the entry gets locked with an
    ephemeral node (instead of deleted). If an error occurs, this lock gets
    released so that others could retake the entry. This adds a little penalty
    as compared to :class:`Queue` implementation.

    The user should call the :meth:`FilteredLockingQueue.get` method first to lock and
    retrieve the next entry. When finished processing the entry, a user should
    call the :meth:`FilteredLockingQueue.consume` method that will remove the entry
    from the queue.

    This queue will not track connection status with ZooKeeper. If a node locks
    an element, then loses connection with ZooKeeper and later reconnects, the
    lock will probably be removed by Zookeeper in the meantime, but a node
    would still think that it holds a lock. The user should check the
    connection status with Zookeeper or call :meth:`FilteredLockingQueue.holds_lock`
    method that will check if a node still holds the lock.
